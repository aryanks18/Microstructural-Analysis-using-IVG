Overview:- 
This project aims to quantify material microstructural changes over time using the Vertical Visibility Graph (IVG). The IVG is a graph-based representation of microstructures that allows for the analysis of evolving trends in material properties.

Features:- 
Image Processing: Converts images to the Vertical Visibility Graph.
Visibility Algorithm: Determines pixel visibility using FCC directions.
Graph Construction: Constructs IVGs using the NetworkX library.
Analysis Tools: Calculates degree distribution curves and applies statistical measures (Mean, Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis) to assess temporal changes.
